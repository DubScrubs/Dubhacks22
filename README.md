#Touch grass
A way to create less

##Inspiration

Throughout the past few years, for those who use social media, one issue that arises is not knowing how to post or one has nothing to post. So we wanted to create a platform that will include and promote a wider range of engagement for those who want to interact more with their peers socially but have been feeling this way.

We wanted to center this app around students at university campuses to connect them with their peers. 

Additionally, with the busy schedules of many college students, some donâ€™t make time to do other activities, and we wanted to have a feature that will also encourage them to take a break with an activity to do.
